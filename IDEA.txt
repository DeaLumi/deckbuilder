1. WIPE OUT CURRENT SYSTEM
2. Use a pseudo-infinite-canvas:
	a. Manage scrolling manually with an offset, triggered on drag from cardAt = null
	b. Bound-out coordinates of offscreen objects
	c. Handle labels like before!
	d. Define a layout engine to assign coordinates to cards, and nothing more!

This should absolve us of the responsibility for the render-layout loop (layout just resizes the canvas and rerenders. EZPZ.).
